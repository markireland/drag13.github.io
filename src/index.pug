      `A few months ago I worked on the performance improvements for one React-based web application. I tried different tricks to improve initial application loading and I was really annoyed with the way of testing my changes. I had to launch the application several times to get average results. I had to repeat all launches against at least two types of networks (4g and my current). And I must do all mentioned once again for cache and cashless scenarios. So, for the one single change, I must run at least 12 tests. This was not fun.
      I decided that I don\'t want to do this anymore and this is how the Perfrunner appeared.`,
